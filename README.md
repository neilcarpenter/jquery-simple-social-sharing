# Super simple social sharings with jQueries

Just for Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus at the mo, opens up proper share dialog, none of that cheap `sharer.php?url=whatever` crap.

## Usage

Mark up yo links as per:

	<a data-[TYPE]="[SITE]" data-[CONTENT]="CONTENT" href="[CANONICAL SHARE URL]">Share on the [SITE]</a>

So for a real world example:

	<a data-share="facebook" data-title="Gizoogle that shiznit" data-link="http://gizoogle.net" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=gizoogle.net">Tell your Facebook friends! They'll love it!!</a>


And then the jQuery:

	$( parentContainer ).socialSharers();

It's using parent container for selector to allow event delegation, I'm presuming you would always have twitter and facebook buttons; google plus just to keep everyone happy. It doesn't matter if you only have one, still just use parent container, or just `document`, whatever.

And for some customisation extras:

	$( parentContainer ).socialSharers({
		twitter: {
			handle: 'neilcarpenter' // will add 'via @neilcarpenter' on tweets
		},
		facebook: {
			appID: 144136645754967 // will load FB SDK asynchronously and add 'via [FB APP NAME]'
		},
		googleplus: {
			// no options yet
		}
	});

All content / events are handled through data-* attributes on the links themselves, so your options are:

- data-share => 'facebook' | 'twitter' | 'googleplus'
- data-title => Title of content to share (fb), or share text (tw). *Defaults to document `<title>`*
- data-link => Link to share. *Defaults to current `window.location.href`*
- data-image => Picture to share (fb only)
- data-description => Share text (fb only)
- data-hashtags => Comma-separated list of hashtags (tw only)

**Check `demo.html` for working example.**
